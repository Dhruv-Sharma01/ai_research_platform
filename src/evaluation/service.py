Grade the relevance of the chunk to the query. Respond with EXACTLY one of these three words followed by a pipe and a brief reasoning:

relevant|<reasoning>
ambiguous|<reasoning>
not_relevant|<reasoning>

Rules:
- "relevant" means the chunk directly answers or is clearly useful for the query.
- "ambiguous" means the chunk is partially related but may not fully answer the query.
- "not_relevant" means the chunk has no meaningful connection to the query.
- Your response must start with the grade, followed by a pipe character, followed by reasoning.
- Do not include any other text.
